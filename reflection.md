Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment and answer the prompts.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Test your `ping` and `traceroute` programs on 4 target hosts, each on a different continent and include the output below.

This assignment was really difficult for me because I have only used replit and have limited knowledge of pyCharm, so it took a lot to figure this out. If someone were to take this course in the future, I would advise to start early and look up the things you don't know.
I also was really confused on what the struct import was and how to use it, so I googled that to figure out the details. 

I pinged bbcnews (www.bbcnews.com) in England and this was the output:

I pinged a school in China (www.tsinghua.edu.cn) and this was the output:

Lastly, I pinged a news outlet in New Zealand (www.odt.co.nz):
0.12140703201293945
0.047737836837768555
0.05593395233154297

0.03601670265197754
0.04630899429321289
0.051763296127319336
0.022597074508666992
0.01828908920288086

The news outlet in NZ took the longest, which makes sense because it is the farthest geographically.
